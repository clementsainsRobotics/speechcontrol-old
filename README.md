# SpeechControl

=====================================
Speech recognition software for human beings.

***

SpeechControl has its own [website](http://thesii.org/wiki/SpeechControl) and 
[git repository](https://github.com/thesii/speechcontrol); feel free to check it out.

## Introduction

SpeechControl's the attempt of the Synthetic Intellect Institute to
provide an efficient means of speech recognition technologies to the
Linux desktop. SpeechControl is a speech recognition toolkit, allowing
you to:

  * train multiple acoustic models
  * manipulate and redistribute sessions made with SpeechControl.
  * upload session information to VoxForge
  * dictate text to applications
  * control your desktop using arbitrary commands
  * provide speech recognition to other applications

## Installation

For more detailed instructions look into the INSTALL file.
Usual build procedure is as follows:

    $ python daemonsetup.py build
    $ python packagesetup.py build
    $ python trainersetup.py build

    # python daemonsetup.py install
    # python packagesetup.py install
    # python trainersetup.py install

## Testing

First and foremost issue the following commands:

    $ ./mk-scdirs
    $ ./mk-psext

We use nosetests for launching tests - go to the directory with a subproject
(daemon, for example) and run `nosetests' from there. You should see the report.

Because of the interactive nature of the PocketSphinx (it needs voice input
from microphone) there are special tests (under tests/special) that you have to
run yourself - they will usually need your voice input.

## Bug Reporting

Use our GitHub Issues feature enabled for SpeechControl to post about problems.

## Contact
You can reach the development team behind SpeechControl at their
mailing list spchcntrl-devel@thesii.org. The people who helped produce
and also use SpeechControl have a mailing list at spchcntrl-users@thesii.org.
You can openly subscribe and add content to both of these mailing lists.
Thank you for using our software. More information regarding SpeechControl
